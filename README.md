# Phonebook-Management-System
Write a simple functions-based C++ program to design a phonebook using file handling.
A company tries to keep phone numbers of its employees in a phone book along with the 4-digit numeric employee id, their full name and their11 digit contact number as follows:

Employee_Id               Employee_FName                         Employee_LName           Contact Number
2344                          Ahmad                                   Kamal                 03349178539
2349                          Arslan                                   Khan                 03236781234
2357                          Majid                                    Ahmed                03219012785
2372                          Sarah                                    Ali                  03348912356

Design a menu driven program to perform the following operations using functions for each:
1.	Add an employee record in the file, it includes his id, name, and contact number. Ensure that the id must be a 4-digit number and Contact number must be of 11 digits.
2.	Search and display employee record by his/her id. User will enter the id of the employee and the program will display the complete record if it exists or display appropriate message of not found.
3.	Search and display employee record by his/her F_Name. User will enter the First Name of the employee and the program will display the complete record if it exists or display appropriate message of not found.
4.	Delete the record of a particular employee on basis of id. (To delete you must copy all the text in another file and write back to the original file by skipping the record to delete).
